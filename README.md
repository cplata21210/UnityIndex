# UnityIndex
Unity Index for Bibliometric Analisys 
Unity index- an index designed in response to the call to find a more holistic way to assess scientific production. In this case, the scientific production is understood from a multivariate perspective using the existing measurements such as the number of publications, citations and the H-Index and can be used especially when generating or assessing the production in bibliometric studies. The index consists of a 3-part point system where points are assigned to the authors based on their position in the rank of the 3 traditional indicators for production, acceptance and impact. The index is calculated by attributing 1 point to the author with most published articles and increasing the number of points attributed by 1 to all the subsequent authors. The same point attribution is done to the remaining 2 indicators acceptance -citations- and impact -h-index-.In the presented method, 3 different means of calculation are shared. Finally, the method is validated and different ways to analyze the results and generate insights are suggested.
The reader can find and "Excel Macro" or a "Jupyter Notebook" to make the calculation of the index.
